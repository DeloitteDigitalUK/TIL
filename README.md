#Today I Learnt#

We constantly learn new things. This is a repo to share those learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining concepts, bits of syntax, commands, or tips we've recently learned.

For new TILs, watch this repo or follow [@dd_TIL](https://twitter.com/dd_TIL) on Twitter.

The TIL idea is heavily inspired by [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
